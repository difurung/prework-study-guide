        <h2>CSS</h2>

          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. </li>
          <li>CSS adds style and color to the existing HTML framework. </li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. </li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. </li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. </li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply. </li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. </li>
          <li>Multiple declarations are called a declaration block. </li>
          <li>We use the link element in HTML to link the CSS style sheet to the HTML file. </li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer ezecutes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <lii>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</lii>
          <li> Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Unlike a for loop, the function does not automatically execute when JavaScript is run.</li>
